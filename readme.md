Old http://www.openwaters-dive.com/ website.

A great deal of the source code is here and as such the temporary website where I uploaded it to is obviously not fully functional. You can have a look here http://www.tvt.comoj.com/

I was responsible for the backend and some bits of the front-end (javascript mostly). My code is mixed with the code of the front end team. This website was developed a few years ago where I coded it from scratch using no MVC framework or jQuery. You can access the admin area on http://www.tvt.comoj.com/admin, the password is "teste", you don't need the username.

"Actualidades" stands for "News" where you can add and remove news. Don't click in any other flag to right side of the admin page other than the portuguese one. It works on the backend, but it's missing an option to change it in the frontend (main site). Therefore if you add any news with the english flag set you won't be able to see them in the main page, so stick to the portuguese flag which is the default one.

"Calendario" stands for "Calendar" and you can add any events any day you want. This will show on the front page as you browse through the calendar.

"Disponibilidade" means "Availability". It allows to set which days you can't book. You just have to click on the day you want. Then if you go to http://www.tvt.comoj.com/rform.php to make a reservation, you will see that when you click on the calendar symbol you can't book for the 5th of February which I set to be unavailable.

"Formação" means "Formation" and displays completed forms through http://www.tvt.comoj.com/fform.php. All these forms where shown in a pop up when the website was live and well.

"Livro de Visitas" means "Guestbook" where you can accept and delete any entries. You would insert new comments through http://www.tvt.comoj.com/gform.php

"Sócios" means "Members" where it lists all members. You could become a member by filling in http://www.tvt.comoj.com/mform.php

"Newletter" where you could send emails to members

"Reservas" means "Bookings" where you could make reservations through http://www.tvt.comoj.com/rform.php
